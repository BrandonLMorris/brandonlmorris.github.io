# Welcome

I am an Ph.D. student of Computer Science with a focus on Artificial
Intelligence at Arizona State University. I currently study deep learning and
artificial intelligence more broadly with a particular focus on computer vision
models. In 2018 I received my undergraduate degrees in software engineering and
applied mathematics from Auburn University, where I also conducted research
under [Dr.  Anh Nguyen][nguyen].

## Research Interests

Deep learning is an incredibly powerful and popular machine learning technique,
but it is not without its own set of [limitations][marcus]. I'm interested in
understanding these shortcomings and devising novel approaches to overcome them.
This includes working on problems like [adversarial examples][ae] and expanding
new architectures like [capsule networks][capsules]. Ultimately, I want to make
deep learning more robust, more practical, and more useful within our society.
