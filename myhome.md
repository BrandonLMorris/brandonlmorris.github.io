# Welcome

I am an undergraduate researcher in deep learning at Auburn University. I
currently study [adversarial examples][ae] in computer vision models in [Dr. Anh
Nguyen's][nguyen] lab. My majors are applied mathematics and software
engineering, and I expect to graduate in May of 2018.

## Research Interests

I'm fascinated by deep learning, and hope to pursue a Ph.D. in artificial
intelligence after graduation. My particular interests lie in **deep neural
network architectures** and **novel training procedures**. Practically, I study
these in the application of __computer vision__, and strive to improve how
current deep learning models understand the physical world we live in.
