  - title: "Hard Disk Failure Predictor"
    company: "Sandia National Labs"
    role: "Intern, Lead developer"
    skills: "Machine learning, scikit-learn, fast.ai, technical writing"
    year: 2018

      I leveraged machine learning to create a classifier that inputs raw
      S.M.A.R.T. attributes and predicts if the disk is likely to soon fail.
      Using a real-world dataset from Backblaze, we achieved a precision score
      of 0.97 when trained over 120,000 disks of numerous models and
      manufacturers.
  - title: Test Bed as a Service (TBaaS)
    year: 2016
    company: ADTRAN
    role: Intern, developer
    more_info: https://www.adtran.com/index.php/blog/technology-blog/269-creating-integration-test-environments-at-adtran
    skills: Docker, Python, Celery, cloud computing
    description: |
      For more consistent, reproduceable testing, ADTRAN uses an internal IaaS
      system that allows for the dynamic creation, utilization, and deletion of
      testbeds that often involve clusters of virtual machines. Test Bed as a
      Service (TBaaS) is that system, working as a cloud service running on top
      of Docker. My involvement included daily maintence of the system,
      intefacing with internal customers, and developing new features like test
      bed expiration.
  - title: Firefly node-admin
    year: 2016
    role: Intern, developer
    company: ADTRAN
    skills: Python, cloud computing
    more_info: https://www.adtran.com/index.php/blog/technology-blog/212-dockercon-16
    description: |
      ADTRAN's Firefly product is designed from the ground up to be a
      distributed, cloud-based networking management app. As such, it needs
      substantial tooling to create and manage the clusters it runs on. The
      node-admin tool allows for the provisioning and configuration of
      individual pieces of a Firefly cluster. My involvement included a
      substantial refactoring of the tool making it much easier to understand
      and extend the tool's codebase.
  - title: Firefly Gradle Build Plugin
    year: 2016
    company: ADTRAN
    skills: Gradle, Groovy
    more_info: https://www.adtran.com/index.php/blog/technology-blog/356-announcing-the-gradle-scala-multiversion-plugin
    description: |
      The Firefly product follows a microservice architecture, and individual
      installs vary vary tremendously. As such, a special Gradle build plugin
      was developed to facilitate the processes. My involvement included
      improving the plugin such that the final binaries utilized 50% less disk
      space than before.

    - title: "VectorDefense: Vectorization as a Defense to Adversarial Examples"
      authors: Vishaal Munusamy Kabilan, Brandon L. Morris, Anh Nguyen
      skills: TensorFlow, deep learning
      role: Co-author
      description: |
        Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to being fooled by small
        perturbations in their input, known as adversarial examples. We propose
        a new defense to adversarial attacks that involves converting the
        bitmap imapge into a vector graphic using the popular Potrace algorithm
        before converting back and classifying. This simple preprocessing step
        has a substantial benefit to preventing the effectiveness of
        adversaries, as we demonstrate compared to numerous attacks and
        defenses on the MNIST dataset.

    - title: "Survey on the Robustness of Neural Networks to Adversarial Examples"
      authors: Brandon L. Morris, Anh Nguyen
      role: Lead author
      skills: Technical writing
      description: |
        Deep neural networks are extremely performant on a wide range of
        machine learning tasks, but can be easily fooled by small changes to
        the input. These "adversarial examples" pose a serious threat to deep
        learning's ability to be fully leveraged in real-world environments. We
        take a comprehensive look at the state of research into adversarial
        examples in deep learning, looking at the different attacks, defenses,
        and theoritical hypotheses.

    - title: "MPIgnite: An MPI-like Language and Protytpe for Apache Spark"
      authors: Brandon L. Morris, Anthony Skjellum
      role: Lead author
      skills: Apache Spark, MPI, HPC, cloud computing
      description: |
        Task-parallel code common on modern supercomputers relies heavily on
        the Message Passing Interface, or MPI. However, MPI is very low level,
        requires intimate domain knowledge, and is difficult to refactor. We
        take the spirit of MPI and implement a similar API into the Apache
        Spark data processing engine. Without compromising Spark's strength of
        data-parallel capabilities, we introduce a flexible system that also
        allows for MPI-like programming in a popular cloud platform.

    - title: "MCGPU: Monte Carlo GPU Chemistry Simulator"
      role: Intern, core developer
      skills: C++, OpenACC
      description: |
        MCGPU leverages GPU programming to accelerate chemistry simulations. In
        the Monte Carlo simulation, the energies between and within molecules
        needs to be repeatedly calculated as the dynamics of the system shift.
        These operations are highly parallelizable, and thus well-suited for
        the GPU. My contributions to the project involved substantially
        refactoring the system, making it easier to understand and expand, as
        well as introducing new intra-molecular energy calculations to the
        system.

      role: Backend lead, frontend contributor
      year: 2018
      description: |
        For our senior design project, we were tasked with meeting with a
        professor from Building Science to design a technical solution for his
        research project. Building designers utilize Navisworks 3D design
        software, and builders and maintainers document parts and
        specifications elsewhere. We sought to integrate the underutilized
        digital design documents with the day-to-day information necessary to
        keep university buildings running. We designed and implemented a
        client-server application with a web app for easy modification of
        information that leveraged a REST API that could easily be consumed by
        the Navisworks applicaton.
