  description: "Paper presentation of 'Dynamic Routing Between Capsules'.
  Capsules are groups of neurons that contain extra information about an
  entity's size, pose, location, etc. than typically capable in a deep convnet.
  This paper demonstrates how a shallow capsule network can be used in
  conjuction with 'routing by agreement' to acheive near-state of the art in
  image classification tasks."
